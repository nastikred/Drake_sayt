<a name=1>  </a>  Real Life <embed src=16.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin'
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin'
It's all I know, never learned much more

		Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
		Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
		Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
		I seemed to push them away

	That's real life, oh oh oh
	Real life, ooh
	Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
	That real life, real life, real life, real life

I know you don't really understand it
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
I heard that love is a risk worth taking
I wouldn't know, never been that boy

		Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
		Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
		Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
		I seemed to push them away
		
	That's real life, oh oh oh
	Real life, ooh
	Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
	That real life, real life, real life, real life

Heaven only lets a few in
(Heaven only lets a few in)
It's too late for me to choose it
(It's too late for me to choose it)
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone

	That's real life, oh oh oh
	Real life, ooh
	Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
	That real life, real life, real life, real life
	
	That's real life, oh oh oh
	Real life, ooh
	Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh (ooh mama!)
	Yeah, yeah, real life, real life, real life, real life


<a name=2>  </a>  Losers <embed src=17.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you
Because stupid's next to "I love you"

	No? So what can you show me
	That my heart don't know already
	We make our own sense
	And you're qualified to me
	What can you show me
	That my heart don't know already
	We make our own sense
	And you're qualified
	And you're qualified

Only losers go to school
They can't teach what they can't prove
Come put this inside a test-tube
Because stupid's next to "I love you"
	
	So what can you show me
	That my heart don't know already?
	We make our own sense
	You're qualified to me
	What can you show me
	That my heart don't know already?
	Cause we make our own sense
	And you're qualified


And you're qualified to-
And you're qualified

And now that we're all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that we've gone this far
Who do we owe it all to?
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose? Do we lose?

	So what can you show me
	That my heart don't know already?
	Cause we make our own sense
	And you're qualified to me
	What can you show me
	That my heart don't know already?
	Cause we make our own sense
	And you're qualified to me
	And you're qualified to me

  
 
<a name=3>  </a> Tell Your Friends <embed src=18.mp3 height=60 width=144>

We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
	How I roll, how I be on the low
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it
	I'm that nigga with the hair
	Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
	How I roll, how I be on the low
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it
	I'm that nigga with the hair
	Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
	How I roll, how I be on the low
	Go tell your friends about it (About it)
	Go tell your friends about it
	I'm that nigga with the hair
	Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
	

<a name=4>  </a>  Often <embed src=19.mp3 height=60 width=144>

"Seneler sürer her günüm"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Seneler sürer her günüm"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous


	She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
	Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
	Bitches down to do it either way, often
	Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class grey 'matic
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

	She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
	Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
	Bitches down to do it either way, often
	Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often

Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

	She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
	Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
	Bitches down to do it either way, often
	Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often, often, girl I do this often
	Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
	Often

"Seneler sürer her günüm"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Seneler sürer her günüm"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
"Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum"
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah


<a name=5>  </a>  The Hills <embed src=20.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time that I'll be by your side
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, yeah
	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time I'd ever call you mine
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time that I'll be by your side
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, yeah
	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time I'd ever call you mine
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time that I'll be by your side
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, yeah
	I only call you when it's half past five
	The only time I'd ever call you mine
	I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me
	When I'm * up, that's the real me, babe
