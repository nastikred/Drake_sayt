I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

		House so empty, need a centerpiece
		20 racks a table cut from ebony
		Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
		Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
		You talking money, need a hearing aid
		You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
		Switch up my style, I take any lane
		I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

	Look what you've done
	I’m a * starboy
	Look what you've done
	I'm a * starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

		House so empty, need a centerpiece
		20 racks a table cut from ebony
		Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
		Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
		You talking money, need a hearing aid
		You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
		Switch up my style, I take any lane
		I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

	Look what you've done
	I’m a *starboy
	Look what you've done
	I'm a* starboy

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

		House so empty, need a centerpiece

<a name=2>  </a> False Alarm <embed src=22.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
The truth, the truth

		She loves everybody
		Can't you tell by the signs?
		She loves everybody
		She gets off all the time
		It's a dark philosophy
		And it haunts her constantly
		It's a false alarm to me
		She's a false alarm

	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
Enough, enough

		She loves everybody
		Can't you tell by the signs?
		She loves everybody
		She gets off all the time
		It's a dark philosophy
		And it haunts her constantly
		It's a false alarm to me
		She's a false alarm

	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
	
She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better

	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
	False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
	
<a name=3>  </a> Reminder <embed src=23.mp3 height=60 width=144>
  
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein (Lo Mein)

	(Oh-oh-oh)
	You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
	You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
	You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
	Every time you try to forget who I am
	I'll be right there to remind you again
	You know me (Pow! Pow!), you know me (Know me)

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause-

	You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
	You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
	You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
	You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
	Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
	I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey!)
	You know me (Pow! Pow!), you know me (Know me, know me)

Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

'Cause you know me, they know me
You ain't know me, now you know me
Oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na

<a name=5>  </a>  Secrets <embed src=25.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

		It's a lie, a lie
		I catch you every time
		In your lies, your lies
		Every time you close your eyes

	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

		It's a lie, a lie
		I catch you every time
		In your lies, your lies
		Every time you close your eyes

	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe the...
Lies from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
	I hear the secrets that you keep
	When you're talkin' in your sleep
	I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
	When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
