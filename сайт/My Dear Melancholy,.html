<a name=1>  </a>Call Out My Name <embed src=1.mp3 height=60 width=144>
We found each other 
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

	So call out my name (call out my name)
	Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
	I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
	I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
	Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
	Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
	Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
	Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
	I'll be on my
	
I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You're on top 

I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

	So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
	So call out my name when I kiss you
	So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
	I want you to stay even though you don't want me
	Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I-)
	Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
	Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
	Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl
	I'll be on my
	
On my way
On my way

On my way
On my way
On my way

On my way
On my way
On my way

On my way
On my way
On my way

On, on

Any time for you to get my call, baby (so, baby)
Are you alone, baby?

I didn't know you were down for him finding out
I thought you had some kind of love for your man
Well, I'm not tryna break up something
You've been workin' out, you've been steady
But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me
Don't you tempt me

You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you
It might have been, been about a couple months
But I just got the picture that you texted to me
You ain't steady, you look ready to go all the way
If you let me take you down on me
	
	Can you try me? (Try me), try me (try me)
	Once you put your pride aside (once you put your pride aside)

<a name=3>  </a>Wasted Times <embed src=3.mp3 height=60 width=144>

Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself
	And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
	Who you give that love to now?
	Who you pullin' up on?
	Who you gettin' sprung for now?
	And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
	Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
	'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
	I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
	
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin')
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah)
And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin')
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (I'll beat it)
This sex will get you high without no other substance

	So who do you belong to now? (Who do you belong to now?)
	Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?)
	Who you pullin' up on?
	Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?)
	And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot)
	Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (blowin' up their spot)
	'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
	I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (feelings)
	
Catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee
Feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee

Wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
If you ain't layin' next to me
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e
On me, me, on me, oh, I
On me, on me, on me

   
<a name=4>  </a>I Was Never There <embed src=4.mp3 height=60 width=144>

What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
What makes him wanna take his life?
Ah oh (Ah)
His happiness is never real
(Real, real, real, real)
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he feels
	When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
	It won't matter (it don't matter)
	It won't matter (matter)
	When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time, babe)
	It won't matter (it won't matter, babe)
	It won't matter (ya)
	It was like I was never there
	(It was like I was never there)
	It was like he was gone in thin air (no)
	When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (oh baby)
	It won't matter (it won't matter babe) it won't matter
	
		When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
		It won't matter, it won't matter
		When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
		It won't matter, it won't matter
		It was like I was never there
		It was like he was gone in thin air
		When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
		It won't matter, it won't matter
		
Ooh, and now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I'll poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it

And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Woah, woah
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Ooh, no

  
<a name=5>  </a>Hurt You <embed src=5.mp3 height=60 width=144>

And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you

'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

	I don't wanna hurt you, oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	I don't wanna hurt you, oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	
When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again
I'll make you weak
Girl, I'll come and put myself between your lips
Not between your heart
Can't you see?

That all the nights we slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
And if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

	I don't wanna hurt you, oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	I don't wanna hurt you, oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	I don't wanna hurt you, oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	I don't wanna hurt you, oh oh oh
	I don't wanna hurt you
	
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want, baby
I don't want, baby
I don't
