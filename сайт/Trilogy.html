You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

	Open your hand, take a glass
	Don't be scared, I'm right here
	Even though, you don't roll
	Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

Take it off, you want it off
Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good

	Open your hand, take a glass
	Don't be scared, I'm right here
	Even though, you don't roll
	Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this
	Woah, woah, woah, woah
	Woah, woah, woah, woah
	Woah, woah, woah, woah
	You wanna be high for this

For this
You wanna be high for this
Ooh, woah
You wanna be high for this, yeah
You wanna be high for this

Let me take the friction from your lips (Ooh woah)

	And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
	Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
	And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend

I got everything you want with me

And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off

	And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
	Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
	And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend

Been on another level since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me

	If it hurts to breathe, open a window (Woo-ooh)
	Oh, your mind wants to leave (leave), but you can't go
	Oh, This is a happy house (a happy house), we're happy here (we're happy here)
	In a happy house, oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun
	Fun, fun, fun, fun
	Fun, fun, fun, fun

Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But baby it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me, girl, cause you wanted to have fun

	If it hurts to breathe, open a window (Woo-ooh)
	Oh, your mind wants to leave (leave), but you can't go
	Oh, This is a happy house (a happy house), we're happy here (we're happy here)
	In a happy house, oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun
	Fun, fun, fun, fun
	Fun, fun, fun, fun

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool
It's probably cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal
Ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal
He the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat
Like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

<a name=4>  </a> The Morning <embed src=14.mp3 height=60 width=144>
  
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money she be folding
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money she be folding
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (the money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (the money she be folding)
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money is the motive
	All that money, the money she be folding
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
	Girl put in work

Woah, woah, ehh

I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

		Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
		Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
		I got my heart right here
		I got my scars right here
		Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
		Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
		And that's my motherfucking words too
		Just let me motherfucking love you

	Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
	Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh, yeah)
	Ohh, listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
	Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (Woah, woah)
	So tell me you love me
	(Only for tonight, only for the night)
	Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh)
	Just tell me you love me
	(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
	Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh) (yeah, yeah) (yeah, yeah)

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the Devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

		Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
		Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
		I got my heart right here
		I got my scars right here
		Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
		Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
		And that's my motherfucking words too
		Just let me motherfucking love you

	Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
	Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh, yeah)
	Ohh, listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
	Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (Woah, woah)
	So tell me you love me
	(Only for tonight, only for the night)
	Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh)
	Just tell me you love me
	(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
	Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh) 
	Ohh
